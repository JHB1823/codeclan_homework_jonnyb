The dimensions of the data: 792 observations of 9 variables.

```{r}

```
The names of the variables are:

```{r}
phone_data %>% 
  names()
```
## Most phones

Which brand has the highest numbers of phones in the dataset?

```{r}
# a variable can be added, which counts the occurences of each brand in the df
brand_freq <- phone_data %>% 
  add_count(brand) %>%
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  summarise(n = mean(n), .groups = 'drop_last')
```

After ordering the brand_frequency in terms of descending frequency of each
brand: Samsung is the most commonly occurring brand.

```{r}
brand_freq %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
