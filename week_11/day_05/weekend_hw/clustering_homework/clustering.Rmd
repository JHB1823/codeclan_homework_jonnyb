# Reading in and Cleaning data

```{r}
mall_data <- read_csv("mall_customers.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(spending_score = spending_score_1_100,
         annual_income = annual_income_k)
```

# Initial Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
summary(mall_data)
head(mall_data)
```


```{r}
mall_data %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```


```{r}
mall_data %>% 
  summarise(max(age))
mall_data %>% 
  summarise(min(age))
```


```{r}
ggplot(mall_data) +
  aes(x = age) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

Initial analysis:

Number of cols + 5 
Data is pre scaled
customer age groups between 18-70 and there seems to be a bimodal distr to these ages.

# Plot data

```{r}
mall_data %>% 
ggpairs(mall_data, progress = FALSE)
```

Lets have a look at spending_score & annual_income


```{r}
ggplot(mall_data) +
  aes(x = spending_score, y = annual_income) +
  geom_point()
```

There is potential evidence of clustering after plotting spending_score and annual_income. 

K-means clustering is an ideal technique to try identfify meaningful clusters in the data to target the customers.

# Selecting only spending_score and annual_income 

```{r}
mall_trimmed <- mall_data %>% 
  select(annual_income, spending_score)
```

# Choosing a k_value

3 methods will be used to identitfy the optimal k value - elbow method, silhoulette coefficient and gap statistic.

## Elbow

```{r}
fviz_nbclust(mall_trimmed, kmeans, method = "wss", nstart = 25)
```

The elbow indicates that the optimal k-value could be either 3 or 5.

## Silhouette 

```{r}
fviz_nbclust(mall_trimmed, kmeans, method = "silhouette", nstart = 25)
```

The Silhouette method indicates that the optimal k-value is 5.

## Gap

```{r}
fviz_nbclust(mall_trimmed, kmeans, method = "gap_stat", nstart = 25, k.max = 10)
```

Gap statistic shows that 1 should be the k-value 


Based on results from all 3 methods, 5 is the most common number to have been identified as optimal so I will proceed with this number.


# K means clustering 

```{r}
clustered_mall_data <- kmeans(mall_trimmed, 5, nstart = 25)
clustered_mall_data$size
clustered_mall_data$centers
```

# K means visualisation

```{r}
clusters <- augment(clustered_mall_data, mall_data)
ggplot(clusters, aes(x = spending_score, y = annual_income, colour = .cluster)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Spending Score (out of 100)", y = "Annual Income (k)")
```

From the visualisation it can be said there is evidence that the among the customer data there are 5 distinct groupings. Generally there appears to be little spread of data points within each cluster and this indicates that the clustering is a good fit.


# Labelling cluster 5

Within all 5 clusters there looks to be a commonality in attributes but this is particularly evident in the central purple cluster, cluster 5. 

# Labelling Cluster 5

```{r}
cluster_5 <- clusters %>% 
  filter(.cluster == "5")
```

```{r}
cluster_5 %>% 
  summarise(max_age = max(age),
            min_age = min(age),
            max_income = max(annual_income),
            min_income = min(annual_income)
            )
```


```{r}
cluster_5_gender <- cluster_5 %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(gender_percent = round(count/sum(count), digits = 3) * 100)
cluster_5_gender
```

```{r}
cluster_5_averages <- cluster_5 %>% 
  summarise(average_age = round(mean(age), digits = 1),
            average_income = round(mean(annual_income), digits = 2),
            average_spending_score = round(mean(spending_score), digits = 1))
cluster_5_averages
```


Cluster 5 

- 59.3% are female and 40.7% are male 
- Age range is 18-70, average age is 42.7
- Annual income range is 34k - 76k
- Average spending score is 49.5
